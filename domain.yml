      **Vendor Finance** is a solution where suppliers (vendors) can get unsecured funding to help buyers purchase goods without immediate full payment. The supplier acts as the borrower, supported by trade confirmations from the buyer (Anchor). This improves cash flow and facilitates smoother B2B transactions.
  utter_vendor_finance_process:

      3. The Buyer requests funding from a financer based on the accepted invoice.
      4. The financer validates the transaction and disburses the funds directly to the Supplier's account.

      Financer and accepted by the Anchor. 
      04. Pair Limit of Anchor & Dealer/Vendor 

      As per the financial health and risk assessment of the Dealer/Vendor and transaction history between 
      Anchor & Dealer/Vendor, pair limit of both the parties is sanctioned by the Financer and accepted by 
      both entity. 

      05. Initiate Transaction

      Financers approves the verified invoices and disburse funds directly to the supplier, after deducting 
      upfront interest. This ensures timely payments to suppliers. 
      08. Repayment

  utter_sales_bill_discounting:
  - text: |
      Sales Bill Discounting initiated by MSMEs (sellers) enables faster payment cycles by allowing 
      them to sell their receivables (invoices) to a financial institution at a discounted rate. This helps MSMEs 
      receive immediate cash instead of waiting for payment from large buyers (anchors), who typically take 
      longer payment terms (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days). The seller bears the associated costs. This solution 
      enhances cash flow for MSMEs, providing quick liquidity while streamlining the payment process. 
  utter_purchase_bill_discounting:
  - text: |
      Purchase Bill Discounting: Enables buyers to pay suppliers early. Financer pays supplier; buyer repays on due date. Optimizes working capital.
  utter_vendor_finance:
  - text: |
      Vendor Finance: Financial support for your suppliers, ensuring a healthy and stable supply chain.
      Vendor Finance is a finance solution where suppliers (vendors) offer unsecured funding to 
      buyers (often through a lender-approved program) to help them purchase goods or 
      services without immediate full payment. In this arrangement, the supplier acts as the 
      borrower, supported by trade confirmations from the buyer (Anchor), who may or may not 
      provide a guarantee. This enables suppliers to access credit lines, deferred payment 
      plans, or loans, facilitating smoother business-to-business (B2B) transactions while 
      improving cash flow and enabling buyers to make purchases on favourable terms.
  utter_dealer_finance:
  - text: |
      Dealer Finance: Support for your dealer network to manage inventory and sales, boosting your business.
      Dealer Finance provides unsecured financing to dealers, enabling them to procure goods from 
      Anchors (suppliers) without immediate full payment. In this arrangement, dealers act as borrowers, and 
      the Anchor may optionally serve as a guarantor, depending on the terms of the financing. This solution 
      supports dealers, such as those selling cars or machinery, by offering flexible payment options—either 
      through in-house financing or third-party lenders—helping them secure inventory and meet customer 
      demand while managing their cash flow. 
  utter_early_payment_finance:
  - text: |
      Early Payment Finance: Accelerates payments in your supply chain, optimizing working capital for you and your partners.
      Early Payment Finance is a supply chain finance program offered by the 
      Anchor/Distributor/Seller to encourage their retailers/buyers to pay their invoices ahead of
